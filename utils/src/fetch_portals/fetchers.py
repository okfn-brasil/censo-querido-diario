"""Functions to fetch official gazette portals statuses and contents.

This module contains functions developed as a part of the `Censo Querido
Diário`_ effort, in order to periodically fetch the contents and monitor the
service availability of portals containing the official gazettes for the 5.526
brazilian municipalities.

The Censo Querido Diário is a collaborative effort to push forward the
disclosure of public information embodied in official publications.
Contributions to this initiative are more than welcome. Check our
`contribution guidelines`_ (in portuguese) to learn the various ways you can
support the project.
